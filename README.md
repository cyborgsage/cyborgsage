My name is Doug and I recently graduated from the Flatiron School Data Science program in December of 2021.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge in machine learning, statistics, and data science and combining that with my foundation in economics in order to bring value to the business world. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning regression analysis, model deployment, SQL & database design, and machine learning for trading.
